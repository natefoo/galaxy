Galaxy Installation
===================

The Galaxy Installation documentation covers installing Galaxy to run as a
dedicated service, for example, for a lab or institution. If you want to
install Galaxy:

- To do tool development, please consult the `Planemo`__ documentation. Planemo
  is the best practice Galaxy Tool SDK and will automatically run your tools in
  a Galaxy server for you.
- To develop on the Galaxy framework code, or test basic functionality, follow
  the basic clone-and-run instructions on `getgalaxy.org`_.
